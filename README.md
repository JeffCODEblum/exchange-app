This project is a frontend app for currency exchange.

Some usability considerations are:

I would like to add better success/error messaging using some sort of a "toast" package. These messages could pop up and fade out in the corner of the screen. They would have a red or green border depending on if an action succeeded or failed along with a description of the outcome of said action. This would especially be useful in letting the user know when config options have successfully updated.

I would also add validation to the config options so that they can only be within certain ranges, no negative refresh rate or commissions, etc.

It would also be nice to add a login which would store the user's "favorite" currencies to enable faster transactions. No need to show all currencies if a user is always using only one or two. This would likely require a backend though to authenticate the user.

Some maintainability and readability considerations:

I would like to split the home component into multiple components. The modals would be good choices to be separated into their own components, but I was short on time so I left them together for now.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
